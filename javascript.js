    "I enlisted in a university course in Computer Science at State Higher School of Technology and Economics in Jaros≈Çaw in October 2022. Since then I have achieved some successes, one of them being the annual GPA of 5.0 for the 2nd year, achieved thanks to God, after my prayers had been heard. I took many courses in various IT fields, ranging from game development to creating websites. My certificates as well as my CV are presented in the <span class='docsRedir' onclick='goToDocs();'>'Documents'</span> section.",
    "I have been working in Unreal Engine 4 and 5 for 2 years, prior to that, I worked in Roblox Studio and Unity 3D, I have shipped 3 games in total, two of them in Unreal Engine. I am also familiar with Blender which I have been using for creating assets for my games (2 years of experience). I have participated in an extracurricular project at the university, tackling the problem of multithreading. The project has its own article in an international technology magazine.",
    "My most developed skill is C++, since Unreal Engine uses this language. I am familiar with the MPI library which I have used for programming on a computer cluster as well as the .NET framework with which I developed many apps. I also know C#, Java, Python and basics of Lua. I hope my humble site also shows that I have some skills in web technologies (HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript). I have received a certificate upon completing the Unreal Engine Multiplayer Course (see <span class='docsRedir' onclick='goToDocs();'>'Documents'</span> tab). My skill set also encompasses B2/C1 English, verified by an Erasmus Certificate.",
    "I want to start with what is the most important to me - I love God. And I am Catholic. Other than that, I'm also a passionate gamer, I'm elated when I get to binge some games together with my loved ones. Away from the computer, I adore nature, animals and taking strolls, be it with my brother or with my dog. I like cycling, playing team sports and hiking, as long as it's not too demanding. Movies are also a thing that I dig, extra points if I can find some good English in them! Sometimes, when I need to take a break, I go online to share my thoughts with others in English or Spanish. Recently I've taken up archery, too. Among my pastimes, I feel obliged to include tutoring as well. For the past two years I have been giving private lessons in math and English and I love it!"
